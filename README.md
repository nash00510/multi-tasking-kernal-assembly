# Multi Tasking Kernel
### Multi Tasking Kernel written in Assembly Code for the BASYS Board

This project was an Assignment for COMPX203 (Computer Systems). Our brief was to create a multi tasking kernel, written in WRAMP assembly code, to allocate CPU time to multiple programs so they could run simultaneously. I believe this is one of the hardest assignments I have had to complete during my degree so far, a lot of thought and problem solving went into this paper's assignments.

## Included in this repository:
* Assignment Brief
* Files relating to each question in the brief
* kernel_q8 is the final multi tasking kernel file
